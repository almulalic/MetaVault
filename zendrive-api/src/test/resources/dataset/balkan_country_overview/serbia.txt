Serbia, situated in the heart of the Balkan Peninsula in Southeastern Europe, is a country with a rich cultural legacy and a vibrant history. It is bordered by Hungary to the north, Romania to the northeast, Bulgaria to the southeast, North Macedonia to the south, and Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the west, with a small border to Kosovo in the southwest. The capital city, Belgrade, one of the oldest cities in Europe, sits at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers. Known for its dynamic nightlife, historical landmarks, and bohemian atmosphere, Belgrade is a cultural hub that blends its ancient past with modern urban life.

Serbia has a long and complex history, having been part of various empires, including the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman, and Austro-Hungarian. It became a powerful medieval kingdom and later an empire in the 12th and 13th centuries, with its cultural and religious influence extending far beyond its borders. The medieval Serbian Orthodox Church played a pivotal role in shaping Serbian identity, and many stunning monasteries from this period, such as those at Studenica and Sopoćani, still stand today as UNESCO World Heritage sites.

Serbia's modern history was marked by its central role in the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s following the breakup of Yugoslavia. The conflict led to political and economic turmoil, but Serbia has since worked towards rebuilding its economy and establishing stronger ties with Europe and the global community. Despite lingering tensions, particularly around the status of Kosovo, Serbia has made strides toward EU integration while maintaining its own cultural distinctiveness.

Today, Serbia is known for its rich traditions, from the lively celebrations of Slava (a family’s patron saint day) to its cuisine, where dishes like ćevapi and sarma reflect a blend of Ottoman and Central European influences. Its natural beauty is equally impressive, with the rolling hills and fertile plains of the Vojvodina region, the dramatic mountains of Kopaonik, and the stunning Đerdap Gorge along the Danube. Serbia’s resilient spirit, marked by its history of conflict and renewal, continues to shape its identity as a country that bridges East and West.
