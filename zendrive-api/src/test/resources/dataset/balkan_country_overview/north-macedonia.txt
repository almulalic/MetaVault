North Macedonia, a landlocked country in the central Balkans, is a place of great historical significance and natural beauty. It is bordered by Kosovo to the northwest, Serbia to the north, Bulgaria to the east, Greece to the south, and Albania to the west. The capital, Skopje, is a city that bridges the ancient and modern worlds, with its mix of Byzantine churches, Ottoman mosques, and newly built monuments symbolizing the country’s rich, layered past. The Vardar River runs through the city, separating its historical old town from the more modern, government-focused areas, highlighting the country’s ongoing development and transformation.

Historically, North Macedonia has been a meeting point of cultures and empires, from the ancient kingdom of Paeonia to the era of Alexander the Great, whose empire once stretched across much of the known world. Later, the region came under Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman rule, each of which left lasting influences on its culture, architecture, and religion. The country is known for its ancient sites, including the ruins of Heraclea Lyncestis, a city founded by Philip II of Macedon, and the stunning Byzantine frescoes of the Church of St. Sophia in Ohrid, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

North Macedonia's journey to modern statehood has been marked by political challenges, particularly surrounding its name and identity. For years, it was known simply as Macedonia, but due to a long-standing dispute with Greece over historical and territorial claims to the name, the country officially became North Macedonia in 2019. This change paved the way for improved international relations and the country’s progress toward European Union membership.

Today, North Macedonia is known for its breathtaking natural landscapes, particularly the serene beauty of Lake Ohrid, one of the oldest and deepest lakes in Europe, surrounded by picturesque mountains and dotted with medieval monasteries. The country also has a rich cultural heritage, with a tradition of music, dance, and craftsmanship that reflects its diverse history. Despite its small size, North Macedonia remains a place where the past and present coexist in fascinating ways, offering visitors a unique glimpse into the heart of the Balkans.
